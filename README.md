This repository contains materials for an in-class lab/activity designed for use in digital curation education. Materials include: assignment instructions and sample files (.jpeg, .tiff, .txt). 

## Learning Objectives
In this lab you will learn: 
1. how to view & alter the raw contents of a file (i.e., the bits), 
2. how to generate checksums for those files, and 
3. how to use checksums to determine whether a file has changed (e.g., bit rot, etc.)

* Online Hex Editor: https://hexed.it/ 
* Hex Editor for Mac: https://hexfiend.com/
